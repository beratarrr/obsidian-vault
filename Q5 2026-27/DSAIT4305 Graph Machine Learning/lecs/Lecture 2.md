The problem is that graphs are discrete, while ML need continuous vectors, we discuss how we can transform discrete graphs into vectors using only structure, not features or labels.

##### Node embeddings
Idea is to embed similar nodes closer to eachother in the embedding space -> how to define node similarity?; gives us 2 q's: what graph similarity should be preserved?/ how to force embeddings to preserve it.

#### Encoder-decoder
encoder = lookup table producing an embedding per node
decoder = a function that tries to reconstruct some notion of similarity from the embedsÍ
